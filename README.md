# gaiaedr3-6p-gband-correction
G-band photometry corrections for Gaia EDR3 sources with 6-parameter astrometric solutions.

The Jupyter notebook in this repository presents a Python function for calculating the corrections to the G-band photometry for Gaia EDR3 sources with a 6-parameter astrometric solution. The code is listed in the appendix of Gaia Collaboration et al. (2020), and implements the formulae presented in Riello et al. (2020).
